# WelCome My Github

### ðŸ‘‹Hi there! I'm an Embedded and Security developer mainly using C++.
#### I started developing embedded in Linux and Unix environments, and now I am interested in security, so I am developing security!

- I have hobbies about whiskey, running and mountaineering, and I am very interested.
- Another big concern recently is Bitcoin automation.
